Hi Salah Eddine Jouhaini!

Nice to meet you! I'm Salah Eddine Jouhaini, currently a first-year student at Mohammadia School of Engineers. I take pride in being a member of the charity club EMI Khayr and the public speaking club EMI Rhetorica.

Currently, I'm immersing myself in various CS basics, such as full-stack development, DevOps, data science, and networking. My goal for this year is to establish a strong foundation of general knowledge and satisfy my thirst for learning new things. I have a deep interest in technology, coding, and mathematics.

Moreover, I am actively working on enhancing my soft skills, such as project management and teamwork. I am also dedicated to making a meaningful impact on my community and giving back to society.

I am actively seeking captivating projects to contribute to, even if it means learning new technologies or skills from scratch.
